Hi, I'm Lyn, co-founder and COO of LayerCI (YC S20)
At Layer, we're merging staging servers, CI, and pull requests into a Continuous Staging workflow.

1. Create a Layerfile
These are based on Dockerfiles, but build entire staging VMs instead of just containers. Layerfile

2. Install Layer
Login to Layer
Install Layer onto GitHub
3. Every time you push a Layerfile, we'll create a new staging server per-commit for you in seconds
